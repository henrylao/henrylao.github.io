Hello! I'm Henry born and raised in Silicon Valley. I'm currently a third year student at California State University East Bay pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. Solving problems and building software are my passions. On my leisure time, I like to read about machine learning, playing guitar, playing games and reading up on ThinkPad mods.
