Hello! I'm Henry born and raised in Silicon Valley. I'm currently a third year student at California State University East Bay pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. Solving problems and software development are my passions. On my leisure time, I am often reading about machine learning, playing guitar, playing games or reading up on ThinkPad mods.
