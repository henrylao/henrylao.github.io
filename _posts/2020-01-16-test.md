Oops! I accidentally added a large file to a commit and pushed it to the git repository.

The problem:
>remote: error: GH001: Large files detected. You may want to try Git Large File Storage - https://git-lfs.github.com.</br>
remote: error: Trace: ad0eb9492f0f96aa51be007d0d08eeb2d5498d7269c0db67ab2b866f7e404bda</br>
remote: error: See http://git.io/iEPt8g for more information.</br>
remote: error: File src/kaggle_team_project/pickle/stack_gen.pickle is 107.40 MB; this exceeds GitHub's file size limit of 100.00 MB</br>

The solution:
> git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf path/to/large/file' HEAD  </br>
git push

Another painful lesson learned from an hour of searching for a solution.
